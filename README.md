# (code along practice) Pluralsight - Node Application Patterns
Course Progess: Part 3, Section 2 - A Pattern Discussion, 3:00

## Notes / Items Learned...
* Introduced to Grunt. (had always just laboriously worked around needing that before)
    - saw a nice example of where grunt is used to create test data (much like I did with rake at GA)
* Basic node project folder structure
    - additional explanations of modules and organizing them
* Javascript Coding Design Patterns
    - Constructor Pattern, use new and write create/initialization code 
    - Factory Pattern, explicit function call to create an object, with create/initialization code 
* 

## Todo
* Read / Understand Javascript design patterns 
    - Addy Osmani, Learning Javascript Design Patterns (especially...)
    - Module
    - Revealing Module 
    - Prototype
    - JavaScript Namespacing Patterns 
* 

## Course Feedback / Comments
* If you are most interested in node patterns, you can for the most part skip the first one and a half modules. These cover a lot of workflow and tools, such as editors and grunt.
    - Introduction (all sections) and Setting Up Your Project (Grunt, Modules) are directed more at tools/workflow
    - Setting Up Your Project (Organization) is the section that begins to cover patterns
    - NOTE, I also created on a git repo early on (before it was mentioned in the course). This actually created a bit more work, as there was a fair amount of file/folder restructuring just prior to when the course introduces git. I like tracking things from the start, but in the case, patience would have saved a little effort.
* As the course went on, there was more valuable / useful content. A little too cute and sappy though for my taste.  Froggyfrog?!?  Save that for conversations with your kid please.
* Course can be a little 'choppy', ie near the end of module 'Setting up your project' it does not transition smoothly to next module. needs editing, and could be missing a little content.
* Once reaching the third module, I did like the content being covered much better. However, I find the teaching style a little confusing. Quickly touching on topics, and jumping to another. Moves a bit quick, making it difficult to fully absorb/understand concepts and techniques. Also tough to code along (a lot of rewinding)
* Instructor uses poor naming, such as 'args', 'application'. Rereading your code even relatively soon after it was written can take a bit to follow.
* **WTF?!?**   ...the 'Defining a Service' section ended without completing code the instructor started writing. And a few new source code files appeared as well, without explanation.  And the next section 'Dealing With Data', jumps in without covering those gaps. **Punting on coding along.**  :(
    - simply jumps around too much to effectively code along
