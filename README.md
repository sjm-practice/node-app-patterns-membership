# (code along practice) Pluralsight - Node Application Patterns
Course Progess: Understanding Modules, 1:53

## Notes / Items Learned...
* Introduced to Grunt. (had always just laboriously worked around needing that before)
* Basic node project folder structure
    - additional explanations of modules and organizing them


## Course Feedback / Comments
* If you are most interested in node patterns, you can for the most part skip the first one and a half modules. These cover a lot of workflow and tools, such as editors and grunt.
    - Introduction (all sections) and Setting Up Your Project (Grunt, Modules) are directed more at tools/workflow
    - Setting Up Your Project (Organization) is the section that begins to cover patterns
    - NOTE, I also created on a git repo early on (before it was mentioned in the course). This actually created a bit more work, as there was a fair amount of file/folder restructuring just prior to when the course introduces git. I like tracking things from the start, but in the case, patience would have saved a little effort.
* As the course went on, there was more valuable / useful content. A little too cute and sappy though for my taste.  Froggyfrog?!?  Save that for conversations with your kid please.
